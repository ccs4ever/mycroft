Syntactic sugar:
<X| -> <X,1.0>
|X> -> <1.0,X>
YES -> <1.0,1.0>
NO  -> <0.0,1.0>
DK  -> <X,0.0>
det name. -> det name :- <1.0, 1.0>.

(det|nondet) name :- <float,float>name((,|;)<float,float>name)*.

det referencing nondet is a compile error. nondet referencing det is fine. Some primitives are allowed to be nondet.

<float,float> when elided is syntactic sugar for <1.0,1.0>. First float is truth value, second float is confidence.

All paths separated by commas are considered related, and the result from that path is multiplied. Paths separated by semicolons are independent (and for the sake of argument mutually exclusive); they are combined by adding subexpressions and capping at 1.0.
