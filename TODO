- Tests
- Parser (current bison prototype won't work)
- Internet layer (depends on parser or alternate protocol)
- Bytecode? (possibly easier to do a bytecode & then compile to it)
- Lua version? (ESP8266 looks like a *very* good target -- and parser and internet layer will be easier then -- but it'll be a challenge to produce a Lua version for nodemcu that will perform and not take up too much ram. Having a fast and small bytecode might help with this.)
