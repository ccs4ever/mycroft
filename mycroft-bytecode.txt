Ideas for bytecode

Partly stack-based, with some args

mnemonic	description
pushtv t,c	Create a composite truth value with truth=t (float), confidence=v (float) then push pointer onto stack
pred n,a	Create a predicate with name=n (string pointer), a=arity (integer) then push pointer onto stack
sdet		Take predicate pointed to by top of stack & set the det flag
sndet		Take predicate pointed to by top of stack & unset the det flag
